We first claim that running ***Cognac*** does not need to install any unique software. It only requires common deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and TensorFlow.

One thing that needs attention is that to extract input data for ***Cognac***, one must use javalang that is implemented by our authors. We have provided the link.

To test if it can work, you can run `dataextractor.py` and check if the generated file is in the same format as the demo we give in `/dataset/test.json`.
